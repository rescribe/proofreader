HOCR proofreader
================

This is a proofreading tool for HOCR files, primarily designed for
the creation of quality ground truth to feed back in to an OCR
engine.

Line Images
-----------

The proof reader can load in the page images referenced in HOCR
files and display the relevant parts of them above each line to help
with proofreading. To do this you will need to specify the full
path of the folder containing the page images in the "Set the image
directory" section of the proof reader.

Standalone
----------

The proofreader can optionally be bundled into one standalone .html
file by running `make`, which will create a file called
`proofreader-standalone.html`, which is `proofreader.html` including
embedded copies of `proofreader.js`, `proofreader.css` and
`junicode.woff`.

Tests
-----

There is a test suite for the proofreader. It can either be run from
a web browser, by opening `test.html`, or, if nodejs and the jsdom
package are installed, it can be run from the command line with
`make test`. If nodejs and jsdom aren't available `make test` can
still be run, it will just run the subset of the tests that don't
require DOM manipulation.
